in python abstraction means divide in parts
for  eg i have to make problem containing several objects so i divided the whole program into different classes
this is abstraction

encapsulation means ,if we are using a program but doesn't know about the working so the program is encapsulated for us
basically the encapsulation means that to hide the logic details
