Numpy is a python library and it is written partially in python and rest in c,c++  (require fast computation)
used for work with arrays

Numpy arrays are stored in continuous place in memory unlike lists , hence efficient processing . this behaviour is called locality of reference
in CS

#GITHUB enables many people to work on same coadbase



why use numpy

Numpy provides efficient storage
it also provides better ways of handling data for processing
it is fast
it is easy to learn
Numpy uses relatively less memory of storage  data
