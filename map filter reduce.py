# map func is used to apply a funuc to all the elements of a list/tuple format-map(func(),list/tuple) and store in a object is the same format
# let i hav eto make a list and the square all the no of list
# lit=[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
# list=list(map(lambda a: a**2,lit))
# print(lit)
# print(list)

# filter func works same as map but it only works on the true one
# lit=[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
# list=list(filter(lambda a: a>5,lit))
# print(lit)
# print(list)


# reduce has the sam eformat as map and filter it just reduce the list/tuple  in a single element
# reduce is the fuc of functool
# a=reduce(lambda a ,y: a*y,lit) #HERe I JUST WANT THE PRODUCT OF EACH ELEMENT OF MY LIST
#
# print(lit)
# print(a)
